Final Project for Data-334 - Data Visualization - March Madness Tournament Analysis

<<<<<<< HEAD
  In my shiny application, I looked into data from the 2024 March Madness tournament, examining teams' offensive and defensive statistics alongside their win probabilities against Division 1 teams. Additionally, I analyzed tournament winners and losers from 1985 to 2019, including score results. Notably, higher two-point percentages and lower defensive two-point percentages were associated with greater success in the 2024 tournament. The data used in my shiny application spans the 2024 March Madness tournament and tournament results from 1985 to 2019. The aim was to explore team performance metrics and identify trends across different years and playoff rounds.

  More specifically for the 2024 tournament, i will be looking at the at the team's defensive and offensive stats and how they compared to other teams in the tournament to identify significant factors influencing their overall performance and how far they made it in the tournament. For the historical tournament data, i will be looking at the scoring of the games throughout 1985 and 2019 for all the playoff rounds, to identify any high-score records, trends and patterns, as well as examining the difference in scores between winners and the losers of that particular game. All of this will contribute to understanding the trend of the tournament scores and what factors contribute to a team's success in the tournament.
